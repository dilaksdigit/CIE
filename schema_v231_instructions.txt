CATALOG INTELLIGENCE ENGINE — CABLE CANONICAL SCHEMA v2.3.1
PURPOSE
This workbook is the single source of truth for every cable SKU in your catalog.
Every product must resolve into this schema BEFORE any content or channel decision is made.
Content is a BYPRODUCT of decisions — never the starting point.
WHAT'S NEW IN v2.3.1 (ENFORCEMENT EDITION)
1. HARD ENFORCEMENT GATES (G1–G7 + G6.1)
   Every SKU must pass ALL applicable gates before publish. System returns 400 error on failure. Zero override.
   G1: Cluster_ID must match master list. G2: Primary Intent from locked 9-intent taxonomy.
   G3: 1-3 Secondary Intents, unique, different from Primary. G4: Answer Block 250-300 chars with intent keyword.
   G5: Min 2 Best-For + 1 Not-For. G6: SKU Tier Tag required. G6.1: Tier-locked intent fields.
   G7: Expert Authority required for Hero/Support. VECTOR: Cosine similarity ≥ 0.72.
2. SKU TIER ENFORCEMENT
   Hero: All 9 intents enabled, unlimited effort, full schema + Wikidata + JSON-LD.
   Support: Primary + max 2 Secondary, 2 hrs/SKU/quarter, basic schema.
   Harvest: Specification + 1 other only, 30 min/quarter, Maintenance Mode (G4/G5/G7 suspended).
   Kill: ALL fields disabled, 0 hours, any edit = policy violation.
3. CITATION DECAY SELF-HEALING LOOP
   Week 1 zero = yellow_flag. Week 2 = alert. Week 3 = auto_brief generated. Week 4 = escalated.
   System auto-generates content refresh briefs with failing questions + competitor answers.
4. QUERY FAMILY MAPPING
   Cables: Primary = Wiring + Compatibility (8 Qs). Secondary = Installation (7 Qs). Other (5 Qs).
   20-question audit set locked for 90 days. Tested weekly across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Google SGE.
