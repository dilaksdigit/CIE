CIE GOLDEN TEST DATA PACK 
Doc 4b: JSON Fixtures + Acceptance Tests for Developer Validation 
v2.3.2  |  February 2026  |  10 Gold-Set SKUs  |  70+ Acceptance Tests 
  
CIE GOLDEN TEST DATA PACK | Doc 4b | CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 2 
0. Purpose & Usage 
This pack contains 10 fully worked SKU records as importable JSON, with exact expected 
outputs at every CIE pipeline stage (L0-L6). The developer uses these fixtures to validate every 
component of the system against known-good outputs. No component passes acceptance 
without matching these exact values. 
 
Fixture files to create: golden_test_data.json (all 10 SKUs), plus per-stage expected outputs. 
Usage: Import golden_test_data.json into the test database. Run each pipeline component. 
Assert outputs match expected values exactly. 
Coverage: 5 Hero, 3 Support, 1 Harvest, 1 Kill. 4 Cables, 2 Lampshades, 2 Bulbs, 1 Pendant 
Set, 1 Floor Lamp.

4. Edge Case Acceptance Tests 
These tests validate boundary conditions and error handling. The developer must implement 
each one. 
4.1 Answer Block Edge Cases 
Answer Block: Character Boundaries 
GIVEN ai_answer_block with exactly 249 characters 
WHEN G4 validation runs THEN result = FAIL, message = 'Answer Block too short (249/250 
min)' 
 
GIVEN ai_answer_block with exactly 250 characters 
WHEN G4 validation runs THEN result = PASS 
 
GIVEN ai_answer_block with exactly 300 characters 
WHEN G4 validation runs THEN result = PASS 
 
GIVEN ai_answer_block with exactly 301 characters 
WHEN G4 validation runs THEN result = FAIL, message = 'Answer Block too long (301/300 
max)' 
4.2 Intent Validation Edge Cases 
Intent: Invalid Combinations 
GIVEN primary_intent = 'Comparison' AND secondary_intents = ['Comparison', 
'Specification'] 
WHEN G3 validation runs THEN result = FAIL, message = 'Secondary intent cannot match 
Primary' 
 
GIVEN primary_intent = 'Problem-Solving' AND secondary_intents = [] 
WHEN G3 validation runs AND tier = 'Hero' 
THEN result = FAIL, message = 'Hero/Support SKUs require minimum 1 secondary intent' 
 
GIVEN primary_intent = 'Problem-Solving' AND secondary_intents = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] (4 
items) 
WHEN G3 validation runs THEN result = FAIL, message = 'Maximum 3 secondary intents 
allowed' 
CIE GOLDEN TEST DATA PACK | Doc 4b | CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 13 
 
GIVEN primary_intent = 'Custom Intent Not In Taxonomy' 
WHEN G2 validation runs THEN result = FAIL, message = 'Intent not in approved taxonomy' 
4.3 Tier Transition Edge Cases 
Tier: SKU Moves from Support to Kill 
GIVEN SKU BLB-LED-B22-8W currently tier='Support' with content 
WHEN ERP sync recalculates composite_score < bottom 10% threshold 
AND tier changes to 'Kill' 
THEN all content fields become read-only 
AND existing content preserved (not deleted) but flagged 'Kill - frozen' 
AND channel_governor sets all channels to SKIP 
AND any pending review queue items are auto-rejected with 'Tier changed to Kill' 
AND notification sent to editor and PH 
4.4 Fail-Soft Edge Cases (from v2.3.2) 
AI Service Unavailable 
GIVEN Python AI service returns 503 or timeout 
WHEN editor submits content for Hero SKU 
THEN G4 AI-dependent checks degrade to manual validation 
AND vector distance check is SKIPPED (not failed) 
AND content is saved with flag 'ai_validation_pending = true' 
AND system queues re-validation for when service recovers 
AND editor sees yellow warning: 'AI validation temporarily unavailable. Content saved but 
pending AI review.' 
AND audit log records 'FAIL_SOFT: ai_service_unavailable, validation_deferred' 
4.5 Concurrent Edit Edge Cases 
Two Editors Save Same SKU 
GIVEN Editor A opens CBL-BLK-3C-1M at T=0 
AND Editor B opens CBL-BLK-3C-1M at T=1 
AND Editor A saves changes at T=2 (version increments to v2) 
WHEN Editor B tries to save at T=3 (their base version is v1) 
CIE GOLDEN TEST DATA PACK | Doc 4b | CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 14 
THEN system detects version conflict (v1 != current v2) 
AND shows conflict resolution modal with both versions 
AND Editor B must choose: Overwrite, Merge, or Discard 
AND chosen action is logged in audit trail
