CATALOG INTELLIGENCE ENGINE — CABLE CANONICAL SCHEMA v2.3.2
PURPOSE
This workbook is the single source of truth for every cable SKU in your catalog.
Every product must resolve into this schema BEFORE any content or channel decision is made.
Content is a BYPRODUCT of decisions — never the starting point.
WHAT'S NEW IN v2.3.2 (HARDENING EDITION)
1. HARD ENFORCEMENT GATES (G1–G7 + G6.1)
   Every SKU must pass ALL applicable gates before publish. System returns 400 error on failure. Zero override.
   G1: Cluster_ID must match master list. G2: Primary Intent from locked 9-intent taxonomy.
   G3: 1-3 Secondary Intents, unique, different from Primary. G4: Answer Block 250-300 chars with intent keyword.
   G5: Min 2 Best-For + 1 Not-For. G6: SKU Tier Tag required. G6.1: Tier-locked intent fields.
   G7: Expert Authority required for Hero/Support. VECTOR: Cosine similarity ≥ 0.72.
2. SKU TIER ENFORCEMENT
   Hero: All 9 intents enabled, unlimited effort, full schema + Wikidata + JSON-LD.
   Support: Primary + max 2 Secondary, 2 hrs/SKU/quarter, basic schema.
   Harvest: Specification + 1 other only, 30 min/quarter, Maintenance Mode (G4/G5/G7 suspended).
   Kill: ALL fields disabled, 0 hours, any edit = policy violation.
3. CITATION DECAY SELF-HEALING LOOP
   Week 1 zero = yellow_flag. Week 2 = alert. Week 3 = auto_brief generated. Week 4 = escalated.
   System auto-generates content refresh briefs with failing questions + competitor answers.
4. QUERY FAMILY MAPPING
   Cables: Primary = Wiring + Compatibility (8 Qs). Secondary = Installation (7 Qs). Other (5 Qs).
   20-question audit set locked for 90 days. Tested weekly across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Google SGE.
5. READINESS SCORING (0-100 per channel)
   Hero SKUs must reach ≥85 on primary channel, ≥70 on all active channels within 30 days.

v2.3.2 HARDENING PATCHES (6 cross-engine-validated additions)
PATCH 1: FAIL-SOFT VECTOR VALIDATION
   Embedding API failures no longer block saves. New 'pending' gate status allows save but blocks publish.
   Retry queue processes pending validations every 5 minutes with exponential backoff.
PATCH 2: AI AUDIT DEGRADATION RULES
   Minimum 3/4 engine quorum required for audit to advance decay timer.
   2/4 engines = scores recorded but decay PAUSED. ≤1 engine = run FAILED, decay FROZEN.
PATCH 3: DECOMPOSED AI READINESS SCORING
   AI Assistants readiness broken into 6 components: Answer Block (25%), FAQ Coverage (20%),
   Safety Depth (15%), Cross-SKU Comparison (15%), Structured Data (15%), Citation Score (10%).
PATCH 4: MANDATORY FAQ TEMPLATES PER PRODUCT CLASS
   Standard question sets per product class. Hero/Support must answer all required FAQs.
   FAQ answers auto-generate FAQPage schema for Hero SKUs. Direct citability multiplier.
PATCH 5: CLUSTER GOVERNANCE PLAYBOOK
   Formal workflow for cluster changes. Quarterly cadence. Max 15 clusters/category.
   <3 SKUs after 90 days triggers auto-review flag.
PATCH 6: TIER-MODE UX COPY & BANNERS
   CMS banners explain each tier to editors. Tooltips on hidden fields. Kill-tier block messaging.
